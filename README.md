# How to run the experiment:
* (1) Create a folder named "Data" and a folder named "Plot" before running the program.
* (2) Define the size of dataset by manually change the n value in line 42.
* (3) Run the program.
* (4) Select the type of dataset. Type 1 for linearly separable dataset. Or type 2 for randomly distributed dataset.
* (5) Enter the noise rate for class with label -1.
* (6) Enter the noise rate for class with lable +1.
* (7) The data will be saved in the folder "Data" and the plot will be saved in the folder "Plot".
